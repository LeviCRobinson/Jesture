# Jesture (Proof of Concept)

Jesture is a gesture recognition app that can learn and recognize gestuers based on the user's input.

## Usage
Jesture is simply a Proof-of-concept and portfolio piece, and Jesture's gesture recognition logic is implemented in a separate backend project, which is **not included in this repo**.   This project focuses on the mobile front-end, structured with **Clean Architecture** and designed to be modular, testable, and easy to extend.  However, in the event of an intrepid reader, interfaces and repositories can be implemented to fulfill these purposes, if desired.

## Features/Technologies
- Gesture recognition via backend API
- GraphQL APIs implemented using Retrofit
- Clean Architecture (separated by domain, data, and presentation layers)
- Dependency Injection using Hilt
- MVVM architecture
- Sensor stream handling (Specifically, accelerometer readings)
- UI Implemented using Jetpack Compose

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re a recruiter or developer interested in discussing the project. I'm happy to walk through the architecture, design decisions, and implementation.
